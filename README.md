Back in 2008, In my free time, I set to write a web application to manage the contacts, members of the basketball club I was playing for.

This repository contains the source code for that web application.

##Important

I don't plan to do any maintenance for it. 

It was built for old versions of php and jquery with practices long forgotten in modern development.
The code hasn't been touched for 10+ years.

So, feel free to use but be aware of those limitations.

In case you need any support, feel free to reach out nonetheless.

## Getting started

The db folder contains the DB creation script.

The file rsc/config.php has to be created from config.example.php to set the database connection.

The file rsc/saisons.php has to be updated to contain the seasons you need to select in the login dropdown.
The key of the array have to match the suffix of the database table names.
